# Car Price Predictor
The Car Price Predictor is a machine learning project that predicts the prices of used cars based on various features such as car name, company, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, and fuel type. The project utilizes a Linear Regression model trained on a dataset containing information about used cars.

## Features
1. Predicts the price of used cars based on input features.
2. Provides insights into the factors influencing car prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Quikr Car Listings. It contains information about used cars listed on the Quikr platform, including car name, company, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, fuel type, and price.

## Usage
To use the Car Price Predictor:
1. Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
2. Run the car_price_predictor.ipynb notebook to train the model and make predictions.
3. Provide input features such as car name, company, year, kilometers driven, and fuel type to get predicted prices.

## Model
The model is trained using a Linear Regression algorithm. It preprocesses the input data, including one-hot encoding for categorical features, and predicts the prices of used cars based on the provided features.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the R-squared score, which measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the input features.
